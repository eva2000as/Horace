# Horace
 
This MOD, Horace1.74, was originally developed by Seifer (Steven D Andrews) for BG2:SOA. It introduces a character called Horace, who is old-fashioned, stubborn, and somewhat comical. Since the original MOD author is no longer contactable, I have upgraded it to the EE standard and translated it into Chinese. If the original author or anyone who provided the original MOD materials or translated it sees this and feels that their rights have been infringed, please contact me and I will remove it.
